## Geting started.

The ICCBR 2024 API is built in 🚀 **Node.js** using ⚙️ **ExpressJS** primarily, using an **MVC** (Model-View-Controller) design pattern to implement user interfaces, data and logic control.

🦣 **PostgreSQL** with the AWS Relationship Database Service **RDS** has been used for the database and the server is deployed on **Amazon EC2** (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud from AWS).

This platform is End to End, meaning it has a flow from start to finish, where the end user (customer) can select the tickets they are interested in purchasing, enter their personal purchase information and process payment using credit/debit cards with Stripe or interbank transfers, finally the client receives their receipt of payment to the email with which they registered.

## Clone the repository to collaborate on the project.

Make sure you have Git installed, it is recommended to use Ubuntu as well. 😉

1. Create a folder where you can save the Back-End repository, it is recommended that it be in the same directory where the Front-End is:

```
git clone https://github.com/aaaimx/iccbr-v1-api.git
```

2. Once you have the repo locally, you will be able to see the structur tree:

## Development and production environment.

The repository has three branches; **prod**, **dev** and **hot-fixes**;

> [!TIP]
> **Branches:** These are parallel versions of the code base that allow working on different functionalities or bug fixes independently. In this case, three main branches are mentioned:

**🚀 prod (short for "production"):** This branch typically contains the stable version of the code that is ready to be deployed to a production environment, that is, the environment where end users interact with the live application.

**🛠️ dev (short for "development"):** This branch is often used to integrate new features and major code changes. It is a development environment where changes are tested and integrated before being promoted to the production branch.

**🔥 hot-fixes (short for "quick fixes"):** This branch is used to fix critical or urgent bugs in the production version without having to wait for the next planned release. Hot-fixes are deployed quickly and applied directly to the production branch to fix urgent issues.

> [!WARNING]
> **Note:** Make sure you don't make changes to the prod branch, much less make unauthorized merges to avoid problems.
